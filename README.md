A collection of Combine publishers for the [Apollo iOS client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios).

## Usage
The extension to ApolloClient (in the aptly named `ApolloClientExtensions`) includes methods whose inputs mirror the existing ApolloClient operation methods. Instead of including a result handler, though, these methods return Combine publishers that deliver the results of the operation to subscribers.

When `cancel()` is invoked on a subscription, the underlying Apollo operation is also cancelled.

`fetchPublisher`, `performPublisher`, and `uploadPublisher` subscriptions will send `.finished` completions whey they are done.

```swift
import ApolloCombine

let client = ApolloClient(...)

let fetchSubscription = client.fetchPublisher(query: MyQuery(), cachePolicy: .fetchIgnoringCacheData)
  .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
    // handle .finished or .failure 
    }, receiveValue: { graphQLResult in
      // handle returned fetch data      
  })

// Cancelling the Combine subscription will also cancel the underlying Apollo operation
fetchSubscription.cancel()

```
